Problem statement:-
You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.
Note :
Input arrays/lists can contain duplicate elements.
The intersection elements printed would be in the order they appear in the first array/list(ARR1)

    public static void intersections(int arr1[], int arr2[]) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
                if (arr1[i] == arr2[j]) {
                    System.out.print(arr1[i] + " ");
                    arr2[j] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                    break;

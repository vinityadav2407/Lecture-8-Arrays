Problem statement:=
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N which contains numbers from 0 to (N - 2). Each number is present at least once. That is, if N = 5, the array/list constitutes values ranging from 0 to 3 and among these, there is a single integer value that is present twice. You need to find and return that duplicate number present in the array.

Note :
Duplicate number is always present in the given array/list.

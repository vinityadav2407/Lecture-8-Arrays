Problem statement:-
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N that contains only integers, 0 and 1. Write a function to sort this array/list. Think of a solution which scans the array/list only once and don't require use of an extra array/list.

Note:
You need to change in the given array/list itself. Hence, no need to return or print anything.
